  CORE harvests, maintains, enriches and makes available metadata and full-text content (typically a PDF) 
  from many Open Access journals and repositories. This makes it a useful access point for those who would like
  to develop applications making use of this content. To support these activities, CORE is providing a free API.

    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since
    the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
    it to make a type specimen book.
