description: |
  CORE harvests, maintains, enriches and makes available metadata and full-text
  content (typically a PDF) from many Open Access journals and repositories.
  This makes it a useful access point for those who would like to develop
  applications making use of this content. To support these activities, CORE is
  providing a free API.

  If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to cite one of our
  [publications](research-outputs).

documentation:

  content: |
    The documentation, along with live examples can be found
    [here](al-swagger-ui-home).

    You can also view some practical examples using the CORE API in this [TDM
    course](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/node/2263).

expected-use:
  title: We expect the API can be used, for example, to
  content: |
    * Perform text mining to enrich metadata of Open Access publications or to
      even perform different kinds of semantic analysis of publications.
    * Semantically annotate (by means of crowdsourcing, collaborative sharing or
      natural language processing) the publications to drive the emergence of
      nano-publications in certain research fields.
    * Link publications to research data.
    * Carry out impact and citation analysis in the Open Access domain. Many
      other services that need quick and easy access to the content of research
      publications, etc.

where-to-start:
  title: Where to start
  content: |
    Please register [here](apikeys-register) to receive an API key and start
    testing the [live examples](al-swagger-ui-home).

    A good starting point to start coding with our API is to follow the iPython
    notebook available [on Github](https://github.com/oacore/or2016-api-demo).

    In collaboration with [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) you can find
    [here](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/cored) an _R_ client for the CORE API.

    Apart from the CORE API, CORE also provides data as LOD for enthusiasts. The
    documentation is available at the [datahub](https://datahub.io/dataset/core).
    Please note the data is not synced regularly. We encourage all developers to
    use the CORE API v2.
