  title: How we use cookies
  description: |
    We use cookies for several purposes on this website – we’ve listed each of them below with
    more details about why we use them and how long they’ll last.

      **Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)**
    description: |
      We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use our site,
      and rough demographics as to what groups of people are using our site.
      We do this to make sure it’s meeting your needs and to understand how we could improve it.
      You can [opt out of Google Analytics tracking](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

      Google Analytics stores information about:

      * the pages you visit
      * how long you spend on each page
      * how you got to the site
      * what you click on while you're here
      * your broad demographic profile (age range, gender, interests)

      Google Analytics does not have access to the personal information you provide us
      (eg your name) so it doesn’t know who you are.

      The following cookies are set by Google Analytics:
