## Our Mission

CORE’s mission is to aggregate all open access research outputs from repositories and journals worldwide and make them available to the public. In this way CORE facilitates free unrestricted access to research for all.

CORE:

*   supports the right of citizens and general public to access the results of research towards which they contributed by paying taxes,
*   facilitates access to open access content for all by offering services to general public, academic institutions, libraries, software developers, researchers, etc.,
*   provides support to both content consumers and content providers by working with digital libraries, institutional and subject repositories and journals,
*   enriches the research content using state-of-the-art technology and provides access to it through a set of services including search, API and analytical tools,
*   contributes to a cultural change by promoting open access, a fast growing movement.

CORE harvests openly accessible content available according to the definition:

> By 'open access' to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.
