[Go back](/about#ambassadors)

While the adoption of open access, open data, open science and text mining practices are growing, CORE is proud to follow these developments and grow as a service. We are looking for enthusiastic organisations and individuals to volunteer as ambassadors to spread the word about CORE’s [mission](/about#mission) and [services](/services).

Become a CORE ambassador to enhance CORE’s efforts in advancing open access and supporting text-mining in your area by:

*   Presenting CORE to research stakeholders (students, librarians and researchers).
*   Posting CORE news on blogs and social media.
*   Sharing information about CORE to listservers (especially local).
*   Presenting CORE during events and conferences.
*   Updating the CORE Team with the community’s feedback.

CORE will offer support to ambassadors on a regular basis by:

*   Building a correspondence with ambassadors via emails and/or phone.
*   Organising skype calls every two months.
*   Offering a dedicated area where the ambassadors’ presentations can be stored and retrieved.
*   Acknowledging an ambassador’s name and affiliated organisation on the CORE website.
*   Shipping promotional material (whenever funding permits it).

In addition, the CORE ambassadors will be the first to have access to new CORE services.

### Outreach materials

To assist the ambassadors in their outreach activities, we have put together some downloadable materials.
