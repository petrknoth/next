CORE is providing a valuable service in support of repositories by aggregating the content repositories hold and curate individually and by providing additional end user services, such as the portal and mobile app, to an impressive collection of open access scholarly material."

As an independent company, we had no obvious access to big, diverse scholarly data - a killer in our drive to develop classification algorithms. The CORE repository, available in bulk, was a breakthrough. Now our algorithms outperform even those from huge publishers."
