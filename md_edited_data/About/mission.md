The mission of CORE is to aggregate all open access research outputs from repositories and journals worldwide and make them available to the public. In this way CORE facilitates free unrestricted access to research for all.

CORE:

*   supports the right of citizens and general public to access the results of research towards which they contributed by paying taxes,
*   facilitates access to open access content for all by offering services to general public, academic institutions, libraries, software developers, researchers, etc.,
*   provides support to both content consumers and content providers by working with digital libraries, institutional and subject repositories and journals,
*   enriches the research content using state-of-the-art technology and provides access to it through a set of services including search, API and analytical tools,
*   contributes to a cultural change by promoting open access, a fast growing movement.

CORE harvests openly accessible content available with respect to the Budapest Open Access Initiative definition:

> "By 'open access' to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited."

## Why is CORE aggregating content?

CORE aims to facilitate free access and reuse of open access research outputs distributed across many systems. We provide services for different stakeholders including academics and researchers, repository managers, funders and developers. Aggregating metadata and full-text content in CORE provides you with the following benefits:

*   Better accessibility of your content and linking to the full-text held in your repository from the CORE Portal cross-repository faceted [search]({{path().
*   Enabling reuse of Open Access content. The ability to reuse OA content is firmly embedded in the original BOAI definition of Open Access. CORE provides an [API]({{path(), which enables others to use the content to develop new applications, to text-mine the content, etc.
*   Higher visibility of the content in Open Access repositories achieved using the CORE content recommendation [plugin]({{path()
*   Higher visibility of the content in commercial academic search engines (Google Scholar, MS Academic Search). CORE optimises the metadata and passes it in the recommended form to commercial academic search engines. This helps to promote thorough indexing of repository content.
*   Improved accessibility of the repository content on Apple and Android mobile devices achieved through the CORE [Mobile application]({{path()
*   Providing validation, monitoring and analytical services for data held in your repository through the Repository Dashboard tool (the tool is currently under development and expected to be released by June 2015). We also provide support to repository managers who experience problems in being harvested.
