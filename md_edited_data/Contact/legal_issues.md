The mission of the CORE system is to aggregate [open access]({{path('_core_about_main')}}) content stored in repositories, archives and journals (later just repositories) across the world. Due to the focus on open access material, our team takes very seriously issues related to copyright. This page describes common questions regarding IPR issues and describes the procedures for reporting content that might be breaching the copyright.

## A publisher requires me to remove content from an institutional repository and CORE in order to publish it.

The majority of publishers should not ask you to do this as they do recognise [self-archiving or other forms of open access](http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/openaccess/read). Please look up your publisher in the following [list](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/browse.php?colour=green) and check if they really do not support open access. We would be grateful if you could report to us any publisher who asks you to remove your content, yet they do support the open access option. Please note that in the UK and the rest of the world, providing open access to research outputs is now often the condition of the research or PhD grant.

If you find that the publisher does not support the open access option, please consider publishing with another publisher that does, as open access implies higher visibility of your research. We kindly ask you to thoroughly consider the open access option particularly in the case of PhD dissertations that were supported from public funds. One of the [requirements for completion of a PhD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy#Requirements) is to demonstrate an original, truthful and significant contribution to the field of knowledge and we believe that such knowledge should be publicly accessible.

Should you still wanted to remove your content from the public domain, this might be possible in the case your content has not been already assigned one of the open access licenses, such as [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). In that case, please read on to find out how to disable access to your content.

## Can you restrict access to my PhD thesis or article?

The CORE system works at the level of repositories. CORE aggregates content that is clearly identified in the metadata of those repositories and access to which is not restricted. CORE regularly reharvests metadata and content from repositories to take into account additions and deletions.

Unfortunately, we do not have the human resources to satisfy individual requests for data inclusion or removal. However, CORE clearly identifies the provider of each resource and therefore we advise anybody who believes CORE should not aggregate a certain resource to first contact the original content provider. We are unable to disable access to items the content provider still offers.

## There is a mistake in my article, can you upload a new version?

Unfortunately, we do not have the human resources to satisfy individual requests for updates. However, you can upload the content into your institutional repository or discuss this with the journal. CORE is being updated on a regular basis and will synchronize the content automatically.

## Can CORE just index our content, but not store it on its servers?

To provide its service, it is essential for CORE to be able to store a cashed copy of the harvested content. This is needed to verify open access sources and offer analytical services (content statistics), uniform access to open access content through the CORE Mobile application, support for text-mining, recommendation tools, etc. More information on the benefits of this approach is available in the [CORE: Three Access Levels to Underpin Open Access](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november12/knoth/11knoth.html) article. By cashing a copy of the harvested resource, CORE is not different from many commercial and non-commercial, academic and non-academic, search engines including [Google](http://www.google.com) or [CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/index). The primary difference from such systems is that CORE cashes only copies of open access content.

CORE aggregates content from repositories registered in [OpenDOAR](http://www.opendoar.org/about.html), journals registered in [DOAJ](http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=loadTemplate&template=forPublishers&uiLanguage=en) or those that requested their content to be aggregated. This means that all the content sources aggregated by CORE must be open access as this is the legal requirement for the providers to be registered in these registries.

According to the official [BOAI definition of open access](http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/openaccess/boai-10-recommendations), we are allowed to _"distribute, search, or link to the full texts of articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the Internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain is to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited."_

As a result, CORE will only remove a repository from its list if its circumstances changed (and also the licenses of the already published content). As CORE is an automated service, we ask in this situation the providers to first opt-out from all open access registries and then ensure that CORE cannot accidently aggregate content by restricting access to this content using the [Standard for Robots Exclusion](http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html). This will also guarantee the content cannot be cashed by search engines and harvesting systems.
